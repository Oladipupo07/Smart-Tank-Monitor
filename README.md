IoT Smart Water Tank Monitoring and Automatic Pump Control using ESP32 and Blynk
# ESP32 Smart Tank Monitor

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart water tank monitoring system using ESP32. It automatically controls a water pump and sends alerts using Blynk.

---

## ⭐ Features
- Water level monitoring using ultrasonic sensor
- Automatic pump control
- Serial monitoring for debugging
- Smartphone alert using Blynk
- Wokwi simulation support

---

## 🛠 Components Used
- ESP32
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump (Simulated)
- Blynk IoT Platform

---

## 🔌 System Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures water level inside the tank. When water level drops below threshold, ESP32 automatically activates pump through relay. When tank is full, pump is turned off.
